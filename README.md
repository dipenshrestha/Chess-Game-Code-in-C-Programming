# Chess-Game-Code-in-C-Programming
Hello everyone!
This project was done by me and my team members for our 3rd project in c programming. So, there may be some mistakes or error in this code..
Turbo C7 was used as a platform so, be sure to install turbo c7 in your laptop and paste the chess.c file in TC/BIN .
